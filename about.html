                                <p>Herald, Goa’s oldest newspaper, is today also by far the largest-selling daily English newspaper in the State (ABC Circulation of 64,089) and the most widely read (IRS Readership of 1,46,000) with a reputation for being fiercely independent. Established as a Portuguese language newspaper in the year 1900, its English avatar took birth in 1983. In a media space dominated by mining interests, paid news templates and “closeness” with political parties, Herald ~ whose only interest is the public interest ~ is the paper people trust.

                                <p>The daily Marathi newspaper from the Herald Group launched in 2012, has in a short span of time become the choice of decision-makers and the emerging Marathi-reading middle class in Goa. Dainik Herald has established its credibility and has emerged as a significant voice that nobody with a stake in Goa can afford to ignore. With innovative editorial features and attention to detail and quality previously not seen in regional language newspapers in the State, Dainik Herald is also the first full-colour Marathi daily in Goa. Indeed, we wouldn’t be immodest in saying this new kid on the block has already carved out a niche for itself.Dainik Herald is the latest torchbearer of the Group Motto ~ all the news and views without fear or favour. The buzz is that our impact on the Marathi reader has been immediate. And this is just the beginning.

                                <p>Junior Herald Is a weekly newspaper, produced according to the best standards Herald is known for, meant exclusively for very young to young children, written and produced for them in a language they understand. It breaks away from the clutter of the buzz of images and text they get online and serves as a paper which is old school and yet fresh. It takes its readers to the simple times, when children put pen or pencils to paper to draw, colour, write, solve puzzles and above all, create.

                                <p>Junior Herald takes its inspiration of giving value added information to its young readers from its seasoned parent Herald, and infuses its own vivacity and robustness and endearing curiosity, which is the hallmark of every child. Junior Herald is for children, of children and largely, by children. With every subsequent edition, it inculcates the reading habit in children and also engages them through books and paper, in the endearing old fashioned way.</p>
